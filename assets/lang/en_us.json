            "answer": "We take great pride in the quality and comfort of our goods. If for any reason you are not satisfied with your purchase, you may return the item(s) within 30 days of receiving the order.\n\n\nIn order to offer our great pricing + fast and free shipping we charge a return shipping fee equal to 10% of what you paid for the product, with the original packaging intact. If you don't have the original packaging, the fee is 20% of the paid value. The fee is always capped at $200. Additional fees may apply for returns requiring special pick-up service.\n\n\nAfter your returned product is received by Albany Park, we will examine and inspect the product and will make a determination on whether the product is in “like new\" condition. If the product is in “like new” condition, Albany Park will accept the return and will credit your original payment method for such product. Refund is subject to applicable return fees.\n\n\nIn the event that an item arrives defective or damaged, please let us know immediately upon receipt and we will make it right. Please note that if we are able to replace the damaged parts of your order, but you decide to return your order instead of receiving the replacement parts, then the order will be treated as a returned order (i.e., full refund, less the cost of return shipping).\n\n\nFor further assistance please send an email to hello@albanypark.com or call our customer service department at 1.800.681.5831"

We do not provide additional packaging for returns beyond what the item is shipped in."
